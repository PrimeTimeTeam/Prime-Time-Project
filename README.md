##Overview:
A simple system to represent a more complex one and test the functionality of a slow brain vs fast brain maintenance procedure implementation. The systems function is entirely to maintain itself. That is at first, it will count indefinitely and while counting, will determine if a number is prime or not. A prime number will trigger two things; First, a problem within the system has arisen, and Second, that problem and its fix will be stored for future, Fast Brain use. Upon the initial encounter with a prime, the problem’s solution is to be determined via an algorithm. Additionally, a random number generator will begin with the maximum value = the current count. This will involve the second, and all future encounters with any number. Similar to the first encounter, primes will indicate a problem but the solution won't be solved for, rather it’ll be retrieved from the system’s “memory”.
