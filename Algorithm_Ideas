Slow Brain
  1) Input Number
  3) If Input even, Input is not prime
  2) Square root of Input, call that number SQ
  3) If SQ == whole number, Input not prime, else continue
  4) Modulus the Input by prime numbers(PN) up until SQ, Input % PN = result
  5) If result == whole number, Input is not prime, e
  6) If result never == whole number, Input is prime

Fast Brain
  1) Input Number
  2) If Input even, Input is not prime
  3) Else check last number (LN) in database
  4) is input less than or equal to LN, check if its store, if it is store number is prime, if not  stored in database number isn't prime
  5) Else throw into slow brain

Speed of Searching Database
  1) mySQL is searched through using queries (EX. "SELECT * from tutorials_tbl" )
  2) can't really write queries anymore effecient than that
  3) possible speed on is to have several table each with part of the overall total...
    Ex. if the total is 100 then 10 tables with 10 entries each...
    Code could than select which table to query through and therefore have less entries to check
